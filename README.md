# Practice in C89
This will be my way of learning and practicing the basics in 
different languages, (simple tasks to test multiple language 
features) C was the first one bc I like it and 89 bc this 
way I can compare it to modern C later on.

I don't intend to reinvent the wheel, I just want to know 
how it works.

## DONE
### Basic language usage
- The basics (unions, pointers, etc...)
- Function pointers
- Generic function arguments
- Variable argument lists 
- Emulating methods inside structs
- Static and Dynamic linking
### Algorithms
- Binary search
- Selection sort
- Insert sort
- Merge sort
- Quick sort
- Iterative factorial
- Recursive factorial
- Palindrome word checker
- Power by recursion
- Breadth-First search (BFS)
### Data structures
- Linked list
- Queue list
- Basic graph manipulation
### Programs/utils
- Basic Terminal Drawing (BTD) library 
- Draw Sierpinski Gasket by recursion
