# Practice in C89
I was bored so here I am doing basic stuff

I realized this could be applied to other languages, so this 
"Practice in ..." might be my new way of learning or improving 
in other languages.

Keep an eye out for my upcoming "Practice in 8080 ASM for MS DOS" 
or "Practice in Brainf*ck"

Jk, *unless...*
